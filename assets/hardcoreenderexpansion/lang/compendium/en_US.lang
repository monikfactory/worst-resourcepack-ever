ec.reg.0=Welcome to the Ender Compendium, the source of all knowledge about the End!
ec.reg.1=The Compendium is divided into phases, each contains blocks, items and mobs you can find in that phase.
ec.reg.2=To reveal information about these objects, you have to discover them or unlock them using Knowledge Points.
ec.reg.3=Then you can spend your points on Knowledge Fragments, which hold the information.
ec.reg.4=Newly discovered object will appear in the bottom right corner of your screen. Opening the Compendium will then show the object.
ec.reg.5=Note that discovering objects also unlocks some of their fragments and gives you points.
ec.reg.6=Prices of objects and fragments gradually increase the further you progress.
ec.reg.7=Knowledge Notes are items found in dungeons and traded by villagers. Using them gives you Knowledge Points.
ec.reg.8=Important progression points are shown in the Achievements screen. Click an achievement to open it in the Compendium.
ec.reg.9=You can use the right mouse button instead of the Back button, and mouse wheel to scroll objects and pages.
ec.reg.18=Pressing the Compendium key while looking at an object or hovering over an item in a GUI will show it in the Compendium.
ec.reg.19=This behavior works with Not Enough Items too, but you can bypass it by holding CTRL.

ec.reg.80=Essence is used to unleash power of altars.
ec.reg.81=Dragon Essence is gained by killing the $e:~Dragon:Ender Dragon$.
ec.reg.82=Fiery Essence is dropped by $e:~FireGolem and $e:~ScorchedLens, which can be found in a variation of $d:BurningMountains:Burning Mountains$.

ec.reg.711=It is possible to locate Strongholds by releasing Eyes of Ender into the air.
ec.reg.712=They contain a variety of rooms, one of which is the $b:end_portal_frame:End Portal$ room. The portal leads to the $d:DragonLair, and needs to be activated using Eyes of Ender.
ec.reg.713=Chests in the Stronghold may contain $i:~adventurers_diary, $i:~temple_caller and Knowledge Notes.

ec.reg.10=Short story of an adventurer, split across 16 pages.

ec.reg.20=Rare drop from $e:Enderman:Endermen$.
ec.reg.21=Drop chance is 1 in 40 (2.5%%), Looting enchantment increases the chance.

ec.reg.30=Jukebox discs with various pieces of qwertygiy's music.

ec.reg.1410=This is the portal to the End dimension.
ec.reg.1411=Once activated using Eyes of Ender, the portal will appear and teleport players who jump in it to the $d:DragonLair.
ec.reg.1412=Unlike Overworld, the End spreads out from the middle, and going far away from the $d:DragonLair will let you uncover many new structures and resources.
ec.reg.1413=The further you travel, the more abundant some of the structures and resources become.

ec.reg.40=Core component of the $b:~essence_altar/0.

ec.reg.51=Basic altar is converted into a specific type of altar by giving it one $i:~essence:Essence$, and 8 blocks and items it requests.

ec.reg.72=Attacking a Silverfish will wake up nearby Silverfish hidden in blocks.

ec.reg.750=Large island made of End Stone, protected by the $e:~Dragon:Ender Dragon$.
ec.reg.751=Several Obsidian spikes with Ender Crystals are scattered across the island. The crystals heal the dragon and explode when destroyed.
ec.reg.752=There are 3 types of spikes:
ec.reg.753=One type of crystal spawn 8 primed TNT blocks that explodes near the ground, and makes $e:Enderman:Endermen$ under it attack the player.
ec.reg.754=Another type has Iron Bars on top around the crystal. This type is usually present on tall pillars.
ec.reg.755=The third type causes a massive explosion when destroyed, and scatters the entire pillar around. This type is only selected for small pillars.

ec.reg.90=End Stone is the primary building material of the End. It is highly resistant to explosions.

ec.reg.100=Special variation of Obsidian affected by gravity.

ec.reg.121=It spawns clusters spread out across a larger area than other ores.
ec.reg.122=Mining with any pickaxe yields 1-3 $i:~end_powder and 2-4 experience.
ec.reg.123=Fortune enchantment has an effect on the amount of $i:~end_powder dropped.

ec.reg.130=A Brewing Stand infused with $i:~essence/0.
ec.reg.131=The brewing speed depends on potion complexity, simple potions brew much faster than with regular Brewing Stand.
ec.reg.132=Using Glowstone, Redstone and Gunpowder requires $i:~end_powder, but the potions can go over the limits of basic Brewing Stand.
ec.reg.137=Most potions can be brewed up to tier III, or when $i:~end_powder:enhanced$ with the Tier enhancement, they can go up to tier IV.
ec.reg.133=It is required to brew special potions using Awkward Potion and another ingredient:

ec.reg.163=Enhancing requires a specific amount of End Powder and ingredients of one type.
ec.reg.164=The ingredient is unlocked by trying. Using an incorrect ingredient will destroy some of the End Powder, but may also reveal the correct ingredient.
ec.reg.165=Different enhancements can be stacked together.
ec.reg.166=End Powder applies enhancing effects to potions in $i:~enhanced_brewing_stand.
ec.reg.167=Applying End Powder to $b:~death_flower partially reverts the effect of decaying.

ec.reg.180=Temple Caller is an Eye of Ender infused with $i:~essence/0.
ec.reg.181=It can rarely be found in Overworld dungeons, $d:Stronghold and $d:DungeonTower.
ec.reg.182=Before using the Temple Caller, it has to be filled with $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$.
ec.reg.183=Using it in the End with $b:dragon_egg in the inventory teleports the player to a temple.
ec.reg.184=In the temple, there is a dark pedestal for the $b:dragon_egg. When the Egg is placed, it will use its power to destroy the End.

ec.reg.190=Ender Dragon is a giant boss with 125 hearts, that protects the End dimension.
ec.reg.191=Nearby Ender Crystals regenerate the dragon's health.
ec.reg.192=Its passive attacks include churning out fireballs, biting that can cause bad status effects, massive knockback to creatures and block destruction.
ec.reg.193=When enough of the Ender Crystals are destroyed, the dragon begins the angry stage.
ec.reg.194=During the angry stage, passive attacks are more powerful, and the dragon also does special attacks (Easy difficulty or higher).
ec.reg.195=The angry stage also gives the dragon ability to scatter Obsidian from the pillars when it flies through it.
ec.reg.196=There are 5 special attacks:
ec.reg.197=Divebomb makes the dragon fly up, and then swoop down through the island.
ec.reg.198=Fireburst consists of the dragon flying above players, choosing a target, rapidly churning out fireballs at it and repeating a couple times.
ec.reg.700=Punch attack quadruples the dragon's flight speed, and then attack a player.
ec.reg.702=Summoning makes the dragon fly high up and spawn $e:~AngryEnderman:Angry Endermen$ accompanied by lightning. When a player is above ground, it will strike the player instead.
ec.reg.703=Bloodlust slows the dragon down, protects it from attack and turns nearby $e:Enderman:Endermen$ into Vampire Bats.

ec.reg.960=Transport Beacon allows teleportation between other nearby Beacons you discovered.
ec.reg.961=They spawn in one of the rare $d:EndstoneBlob varieties, and emit a bright vertical beam.
ec.reg.962=Teleportation consumes $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$, which should suffice until the next phase where you learn more about $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$.
ec.reg.963=Maximum teleportation distance is 960 blocks.

ec.reg.270=A tall tower consisting of various types of Obsidian.
ec.reg.271=They start spawning around 350 blocks away from the $d:DragonLair and are most common until 900 blocks, then they start becoming less common.

ec.reg.892=Both forms slowly regenerate Energy up to a certain point. Too much Energy causes random leaks of Corrupted Energy.
ec.reg.893=Corrupted Energy is also created by breaking a Cluster, accompanied by a fiery explosion.
ec.reg.894=Getting in contact with Corrupted Energy causes massive amount of damage that penetrates armor.
ec.reg.895=Energy in the End moves to areas with lower levels of Energy to stay in balance.
ec.reg.289=Killing certain mobs in the End releases small amounts of Energy to the environment.
ec.reg.896=Energy Clusters have different health levels, which affect the regeneration (or leaking) speed.

ec.reg.770=Block made of $i:~endium_ingot:Endium Ingots$.

ec.reg.800=A chest that stores items you own that fell into the void.
ec.reg.802=If there are too many items inside, there will be a higher chance of new items replacing them.

ec.reg.290=Teleportation gem dropped by the $e:~EnderEye.
ec.reg.291=Using it creates a beam, which teleports the player to a block of mob it hits.
ec.reg.292=The beam can travel up to 75 blocks.
ec.reg.293=Unlike Ender Pearls, the beam will try to find suitable area to teleport the player to, even if it hits the side or the bottom of block.

ec.reg.310=The Ender Eye is a small but very powerful and tough mini-boss with 125 hearts.
ec.reg.311=Hitting it will wake it up. If there eye cannot see anybody to attack, it will fall asleep again and start regenerating.
ec.reg.312=Waking it up will also cause it to destroy weak blocks around.
ec.reg.313=It is made of Obsidian, so an Iron Sword or better is required to deal damage.
ec.reg.314=The eye is resistant to fire, cactus, suffocation, magic and drowning damage.
ec.reg.315=Attack routine consists of 3 randomly selected attacks:

ec.reg.883=Not all ingredients are returned, but up to 84%% of them are retrievable.
ec.reg.884=Damaged items yield less ingredients than fully repaired ones.
ec.reg.885=If multiple recipes exist, one is chosen randomly.

ec.reg.970=A table that extracts experience from blocks and items.
ec.reg.972=It requires $i:~stardust and $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$ to run, it always runs at the same speed. A Redstone Comparator can be used to detect whether the Table is running.
ec.reg.973=The table can process precious gems and materials, as well as blocks that drop experience. The materials are destroyed in the process.
ec.reg.974=Blocks yield triple the amount of experience.

ec.reg.980=A table that stores $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$ and channels it into items.
ec.reg.982=A Redstone Comparator can be used to detect whether the Table is currently charging an item.
ec.reg.983=Breaking the Table causes the stored $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$ to leak into the world.

ec.reg.990=A table that extracts $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$ from blocks and items from the End.
ec.reg.992=It requires $i:~stardust and a low amount of $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$ from a different source to run. A Redstone Comparator can be used to detect whether the Table is running.
ec.reg.993=Stored $b:~energy_cluster:Energy$ leaks out into the environment and nearby $b:~energy_cluster:Energy Clusters$.
ec.reg.994=Leaking can be slowed down or stopped by placing $i:~instability_orb:Instability Orbs$ into the Table.

ec.reg.381=It decomposes when thrown on the ground. When the process finishes, it can either explode, or turn into a random mob, block or item.
ec.reg.382=The explosion does not hurt mobs, but it hurts players, items and some of the Orbs nearby.
ec.reg.383=Brewing it in an $i:~enhanced_brewing_stand creates $i:~potion_of_instability.
