# Translator Guide

## Updating the translation

You can use the following website to merge the changes from the English version to your language:

https://snownee.github.io/l10n-tools/update.html

## About the project name - Jade

It's normally recommended to leave the name untranslated.

## Special option keys

```json
{
  "config.jade.flip_main_hand": "Flip Position with Main Hand",
  "config.jade.flip_main_hand_desc": "Mirror tooltip position when main hand is left"
}
```

Use "_desc" as a suffix to the option key to make it the description (tooltip) of the option.

```json
{
  "config.jade.overlay_alpha": "Background Opacity",
  "config.jade.overlay_alpha_extra_msg": "transparent,alpha"
}
```

Use "_extra_msg" as a suffix to the option key to add extra keywords of the option so that users can search by them.

You should add the keywords according to your language. If you don't want the extra keywords, you can leave it empty.

## Plural form

There is a key called `jade.seconds`, which is used to display the time in seconds. If your language has plural form for describing seconds, you can follow [this guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-localization-messages-formatting) to display the seconds correctly.

I will probably add more keys like this in the future.
